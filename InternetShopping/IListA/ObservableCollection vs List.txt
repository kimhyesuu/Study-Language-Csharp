    ObservableCollection<> vs.List<>
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4196968/observablecollection-vs-list

    ObservableCollection 특징

    - ObservableCollection also implements INotifyCollectionChanged 
      interface, which allows WPF to bind to it.
	
	- ObservableCollection is a generic dynamic data collection that uses an interface
	  "INotifyCollectionChanged" to provide notifications
	   when items get added, removed, or when the whole collection is refreshed.		

	 List 특징

	 - List represents a strongly typed list of objects that can be accessed by index. It provides 
	  methods to search, sort, and manipulate lists. The List class is the generic equivalent of the ArrayList
	  class. It implements the IList generic interface using an array 
	  whose size is dynamically increased as required.
